Updated Portfolio
The idea I have for this is that the menu is the website. So the menus takes up most of the space and when you select a certain area it unfolds to reveal more about me and my work experience. The original site was multiple pages but I remade it so it would just rewrite on one page.
 The fold out is not complete yet. I am still working on the nested hovers.
